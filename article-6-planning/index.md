## ISO HLS Article 6: Planning

This summary is by OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Purpose

**Article 6: Planning** in the ISO High-Level Structure (HLS) focuses on preparing the organization to effectively implement and manage its management system. It ensures that organizations **identify risks, set objectives, and plan actions** to meet requirements and drive continual improvement.

This article transitions ISO standards from a **reactive** to a **proactive** mindset—planning not just for compliance, but for performance, risk mitigation, and long-term success.

Objectives:

1. **Address risks and opportunities** that can affect the intended outcomes of the management system.

2. **Ensure compliance with requirements** (legal, regulatory, and stakeholder-related).

3. **Set measurable objectives** aligned with the organization's goals.

4. **Plan actions** to achieve these objectives and embed them into operations.

* **6.1 Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities**

* Are these risks assessed in terms of potential impact?

* Are actions planned to address them?

* Are the actions proportionate to the risk and integrated into the management system?

* **6.2 Management System Objectives and Planning to Achieve Them**

  * The purpose of the change?

  * Potential consequences?

  * Resource availability?

  * Allocation of responsibilities?

## Example: ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management System)

* **6.1 Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities**. An  electronics
  manufacturer identifies the risk of chemical spills and regulatory
  noncompliance. They implement spill containment upgrades, train staff, and
  conduct quarterly audits to mitigate risks.

* **6.2 Environmental Objectives**. Objective: Reduce hazardous waste by 20% by
  end of 2025. Responsibility: Environmental Manager. Actions: Improve process
  efficiency; find alternative materials. Review Frequency: Quarterly.
  Evaluation: Monthly waste output reports and annual third-party audit.

* **6.3 Planning of Changes**. The company introduces a new manufacturing line.
  Before implementation, they do the following steps. 1. Conduct an
  environmental impact assessment. 2. Update procedures and controls. 3. Train
  employees on the new line’s environmental aspects. 4. Communicate changes to
  interested parties.
