# ISO HLS - Article 2 - Normative References

This summary is by OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Introduction

In ISO standards, **Article 2: Normative References** plays an essential role in guiding the user to other relevant documents or standards that are needed to correctly understand and implement the standard. This article outlines any **mandatory external references** that are crucial for the application of the standard.

The High-Level Structure (HLS) is a common framework applied to all ISO management system standards, such as ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environmental), ISO 45001 (Occupational Health & Safety), etc. The goal is to create consistency in the structure of ISO standards, making it easier for users to understand and implement multiple standards that share common structures and terminology.

## Purpose

The purpose of **Article 2: Normative References** is to list all the external documents, standards, or technical specifications that are integral to understanding and applying the main ISO standard. These references are **mandatory**, meaning that organizations must comply with them in order to fully meet the requirements of the ISO standard.

The article ensures that the standard is comprehensive by pointing out specific guidelines or frameworks that are required to fully implement the standard. Without these normative references, users would lack critical context or technical details required to meet the standard’s requirements.

1. **Identification of Key Documents**: It lists other important documents, like other ISO standards or technical guidelines, which help clarify or support the main standard’s application.

2. **Ensures Consistency**: The use of normative references ensures that the user follows internationally recognized standards and definitions, leading to consistent application across different industries and regions.

3. **Provides Clarification**: Normative references can provide additional definitions, technical specifications, or processes that the primary ISO standard does not fully cover.

4. **Legal or Regulatory Compliance**: Some references may point to legal or regulatory documents that organizations must follow in addition to the ISO standard.

## Checklist

When reviewing Article 2 of an ISO standard, consider the following checklist to ensure that the section is complete, clear, and serves its purpose effectively:

1. **Is the list of normative references complete?**

   * Ensure that all essential external documents or standards are included in the list.

2. **Are the referenced documents relevant to the main ISO standard?**

   * Each referenced document should directly support or clarify specific aspects of the ISO standard’s implementation.

3. **Are the references cited with the correct version or edition?**

   * Each document referenced should include its specific version, edition, or publication date to avoid confusion and ensure that the latest or required version is used.

4. **Are the references properly identified (e.g., by document number, title, and year of publication)?**

   * The references should be clearly identified so that users can find and access the correct documents without ambiguity.

5. **Do the references correspond to specific sections or clauses in the main standard?**

   * Ideally, the normative references should be cross-referenced with specific sections of the standard that require compliance with these external documents.

6. **Are the references mandatory for full compliance?**

   * The references in this section must be essential for achieving full compliance with the ISO standard. This differentiates normative references from **informative references**, which provide guidance but are not mandatory.

7. **Are non-ISO references included if necessary?**

   * Sometimes, a standard may reference documents that are not ISO standards, such as national regulations, industry standards, or technical specifications. These should be included if they are critical to the implementation of the standard.

## Example

Let’s look at a **practical example** from **ISO 9001:2015** (Quality Management Systems), specifically its **Article 2: Normative References**:

* **ISO 9000:2015**: This reference provides essential definitions and terminology related to quality management. The standard uses terms like “Quality Management System (QMS)” and “Customer Satisfaction” that need to be clearly understood. ISO 9000 serves as a foundational document for understanding the language used in ISO 9001.
