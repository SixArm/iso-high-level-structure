# ISO HLS Article 2: Normative References

This summary is by OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Purpose

The purpose of **Article 2: Normative References** is to list all the external
documents, standards, or technical specifications that are integral to
understanding and applying the main ISO standard. These references are
**mandatory**, meaning that organizations must comply with them in order to
fully meet the requirements of the ISO standard.

The article ensures that the standard is comprehensive by pointing out specific
guidelines or frameworks that are required to fully implement the standard.
Without these normative references, users would lack critical context or
technical details required to meet the standard’s requirements.

1. **Identification of Key Documents**: It lists other important documents, like
   other ISO standards or technical guidelines, which help clarify or support
   the main standard’s application.

2. **Ensures Consistency**: The use of normative references ensures that the
   user follows internationally recognized standards and definitions, leading to
   consistent application across different industries and regions.

3. **Provides Clarification**: Normative references can provide additional
   definitions, technical specifications, or processes that the primary ISO
   standard does not fully cover.

4. **Legal or Regulatory Compliance**: Some references may point to legal or
   regulatory documents that organizations must follow in addition to the ISO
   standard.

## Checklist

When reviewing Article 2 of an ISO standard, consider the following checklist to
ensure that the section is complete, clear, and serves its purpose effectively:

**Is the list of normative references complete?**

* Ensure that all essential external documents or standards are included in the
  list.

**Are the referenced documents relevant to the main ISO standard?**

* Each referenced document should directly support or clarify specific aspects
  of the ISO standard’s implementation.

**Are the references cited with the correct version or edition?**

* Each document referenced should include its specific version, edition, or
  publication date to avoid confusion and ensure that the latest or required
  version is used.

**Are the references properly identified (e.g., by document number, title, and year of publication)?**

* The references should be clearly identified so that users can find and access
  the correct documents without ambiguity.

**Do the references correspond to specific sections or clauses in the main standard?**

* Ideally, the normative references should be cross-referenced with specific
  sections of the standard that require compliance with these external
  documents.

**Are the references mandatory for full compliance?**

* The references in this section must be essential for achieving full compliance
  with the ISO standard. This differentiates normative references from
  **informative references**, which provide guidance but are not mandatory.

**Are non-ISO references included if necessary?**

* Sometimes, a standard may reference documents that are not ISO standards, such
  as national regulations, industry standards, or technical specifications.
  These should be included if they are critical to the implementation of the
  standard.

## Example using ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management Systems)

**ISO 9000:2015**: This reference provides essential definitions and terminology
related to quality management. The standard uses terms like “Quality Management
System (QMS)” and “Customer Satisfaction” that need to be clearly understood.
ISO 9000 serves as a foundational document for understanding the language used
in ISO 9001.
