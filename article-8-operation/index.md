# ISO HLS Article 8: Operation

This summary is by OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Purpose

**Article 8: Operation** is the **action core** of the ISO High-Level Structure
(HLS). It focuses on the **planning, implementation, and control** of the
operational processes needed to meet the management system’s requirements. This
is where the organization moves from strategy and support to **actual
execution**.

This article ensures that the organization's **products, services, or
processes** are delivered in a **controlled, compliant, and consistent**
manner—aligned with its goals, risks, and obligations.

Objectives:

1. **Establish operational controls** to meet customer, stakeholder, or regulatory requirements.

2. **Plan and manage changes** effectively to avoid disruption or nonconformance.

3. **Address risks and opportunities** identified during planning.

4. Ensure **outsourced processes** are properly managed and integrated.

## Checklist

Use this checklist to assess whether your organization is executing operations in line with ISO standards:

**8.1 Operational Planning and Control:**

* Are operations planned in accordance with risks, opportunities, objectives, and compliance obligations?

* Are changes in operations planned and controlled?

* Are outsourced processes (e.g., contractors, vendors) managed effectively?

**8.2 Requirements for Products and Services:**

* Are customer and stakeholder requirements clearly understood and reviewed?

* Are there controls to ensure products/services meet those requirements?

**8.3 Design and Development:**

* Is there a structured process for design planning, inputs, outputs, reviews, and verification?

* Are changes to design properly controlled?

**8.4 Control of Externally Provided Processes, Products, and Services:**

* Are suppliers evaluated and selected based on their ability to meet requirements?

* Are outsourced activities monitored and controlled?

* Are criteria for acceptance** and performance monitoring in place?

**8.5 Production and Service Provision:**

* Are operating conditions (equipment, instructions, monitoring) controlled?

* Are unique identification, traceability, and property handling implemented where needed?

**8.6 Release of Products and Services:**

* Are products/services only released after meeting acceptance criteria?

**8.7 Control of Nonconforming Outputs:**

* Are nonconforming products or services **identified, documented, and addressed**?

* Is there a process for **correction, segregation, rework, or informing the customer**?

## Example: ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management System)

**8.1 Operational Planning and Control**. A manufacturing firm identifies
emissions, water discharge, and waste generation as environmental aspects. It
implements procedures, maintenance schedules, and monitoring controls to
minimize their impact. Before switching to a new chemical in production, the
organization assesses environmental risks, trains staff, updates documentation,
and notifies authorities.

**8.4 Control of Outsourced Processes**. Waste management is outsourced to a
certified vendor. The organization evaluates the vendor’s compliance, reviews
documentation, and audits the process annually.
