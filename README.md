# ISO High-Level Structure (HLS)

[ISO: the International Organization for
Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization)
publishes a High-Level Structure (HLS). 

The ISO HLS is a framework that provides a common structure for writing
management system standards by using ten articles that explain key areas.

These ISO HLS article summaries below are generated by OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Article 1: Scope

Defines the intended purpose and application range of any management system
standard that adopts the HLS. It clarifies that the scope outlines the specific
subject area the standard addresses—such as quality, environment, or
occupational health and safety—and specifies the types of organizations or
contexts in which it can be applied. This article sets the boundaries for how
the standard should be used and what it aims to achieve, serving as the
foundation for aligning various management system standards under a unified,
consistent framework.

## Article 2: Normative references

Identifies any external documents that are essential for the application of the
standard. If a standard includes normative references, these referenced
documents are considered part of the standard’s requirements and must be
followed to ensure full compliance. However, in many ISO management system
standards based on the HLS, this clause typically states that there are no
normative references, indicating that the standard is self-contained. This
article ensures clarity about whether other standards or documents are legally
or technically required for implementation.

## Article 3: Terms and Definitions

Provides a standardized set of key terms and definitions that are used
consistently across all ISO management system standards. This article ensures a
common understanding of essential concepts—such as "risk," "management system,"
or "interested party"—to promote clarity and alignment across different
standards. It may also reference additional definitions specific to the
particular management system being addressed. By standardizing terminology,
Article 3 helps organizations implement multiple ISO standards more efficiently
and reduces confusion in interpretation and application.

## Article 4: Context of the Organization

Requires organizations to understand and define the internal and external issues
that affect their ability to achieve the intended outcomes of the management
system. It emphasizes identifying relevant interested parties (such as
customers, regulators, or employees) and understanding their needs and
expectations. The article also calls for clearly determining the scope of the
management system and ensuring that it aligns with the organization’s strategic
direction. By establishing this contextual foundation, Article 4 ensures that
the management system is tailored to the organization's unique circumstances and
is strategically integrated into its operations.

## Article 5: Leadership

Emphasizes the critical role of top management in driving the effectiveness of
the management system. It requires leaders to demonstrate commitment by taking
accountability for system performance, aligning it with the organization’s
strategic direction, and integrating it into core business processes. This
article also mandates leadership to establish a clear policy, assign relevant
roles and responsibilities, and ensure that resources and communication are
adequate. By placing leadership at the center, Article 5 ensures that the
management system is not just a procedural formality but a strategic tool
supported and guided from the top.

## Article 6: Planning

Outlines how an organization must plan actions to address risks and
opportunities that could impact the management system’s intended outcomes. It
requires identifying and evaluating risks and opportunities, setting measurable
objectives, and determining actions needed to achieve them. This article also
covers planning for changes and integrating the planning process into the
organization’s overall management system. By focusing on proactive planning,
Article 6 ensures that organizations are prepared to respond effectively to both
potential threats and opportunities for improvement.

## Article 7: Support

Focuses on the resources and infrastructure needed to implement and maintain an
effective management system. It requires organizations to ensure the
availability of competent personnel, awareness of roles and responsibilities,
effective communication, and properly controlled documented information. This
article highlights the importance of providing the necessary support
mechanisms—such as training, tools, and documentation—to enable the system to
function as intended. By addressing these foundational elements, Article 7
ensures the management system is both sustainable and capable of continuous
performance improvement.

## Article 8: Operation

Deals with the execution of the plans and processes needed to meet the
requirements of the management system. It requires organizations to implement
and control operational processes, including those needed to address risks and
opportunities, meet objectives, and fulfill compliance obligations. This article
also covers managing changes, outsourcing, and ensuring that operations are
carried out under controlled conditions. By focusing on the practical
implementation of what has been planned, Article 8 ensures that the management
system translates strategy into effective, consistent action.

## Article 9: Performance Evaluation

Requires organizations to monitor, measure, analyze, and evaluate the
effectiveness of their management system. It includes internal audits,
management reviews, and the use of relevant performance indicators to assess
whether objectives are being met and if the system is functioning as intended.
This article ensures that decisions are based on data and evidence, enabling
continual improvement and timely responses to issues. By systematically
evaluating performance, organizations can ensure accountability, transparency,
and alignment with strategic goals.

## Article 10: Improvement

Focuses on the need for organizations to continually improve the effectiveness
and performance of their management system. It requires organizations to
identify areas for improvement based on the evaluation of performance, audit
results, and other relevant data, and to take corrective actions to address
nonconformities. The article encourages a proactive approach to driving
improvements by responding to emerging issues, opportunities, and changes. By
fostering a culture of continuous improvement, Article 10 ensures that the
management system evolves to better meet the organization’s objectives and adapt
to changing circumstances.
