# ISO HSL Article 7: Support

This summary is by OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Purpose

**Article 7: Support** in the ISO High-Level Structure (HLS) ensures that the
organization provides everything needed to **effectively establish, implement,
maintain, and improve** its management system. This includes the necessary
**resources, competence, awareness, communication**, and **documented
information**.

Without strong support mechanisms, even the best plans (from Article 6) will
fail. Article 7 ensures the **operational and cultural foundation** is in place
to sustain performance and compliance.

Objectives:

1. Ensure adequate **resources** (people, infrastructure, tools) are available.

2. Establish and maintain **competent and aware personnel**.

3. Enable effective **internal and external communication**.

4. Maintain **accurate, accessible documentation** for transparency and control.

## Checklist

Use this checklist to assess whether the support structure is effectively
implemented:

**7.1 Resources:**

* Are sufficient human and material resources allocated?

* Is infrastructure (buildings, equipment, technology) adequate for achieving
  objectives?

**7.2 Competence:**

* Are employees competent based on education, training, and experience?

* Are training needs identified and addressed?

* Is competency verified e.g. through assessment or observation?

**7.3 Awareness:**

Are stakeholders aware of the management system policy?

Are stakeholders aware of their roles and responsibilities?

Are stakeholders aware of accountability, such as the impact of not conforming
to the system?

Is awareness maintained and periodically reinforced?

**7.4 Communication:**

* Is there a defined approach for communications, such as what to do, when to do
  it, who does it and with whom, and how to do it?

* Are internal communication and external communications planned e.g. meetings,
  reports, updates?

**7.5 Documented Information:**

* Are documents controlled, versioned, reviewed, approved?

* Are documents accessible to those who need them?

* Are documents protected against loss, unauthorized changes, or misuse?

* Are obsolete documents properly removed or identified?

## Example: ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health & Safety Management System)

**7.1 Resources**. A construction company provides personal protective equipment
(PPE), first-aid kits, safety training materials, and qualified safety officers
at each site.

**7.2 Competence**. All site managers undergo certified safety training
annually. Records are maintained, and on-site assessments verify their ability
to enforce safety procedures.

**7.3 Awareness**. Toolbox talks are conducted weekly to reinforce awareness of
workplace hazards and individual responsibilities. Posters display safety
commitments and emergency procedures.

**7.4 Communication**. Safety updates are shared through email bulletins, notice
boards, and team briefings. External communication includes notifying local
authorities during high-risk operations.

**7.5 Documented Information**. The company maintains digital safety manuals,
inspection checklists, and incident reports. These are version-controlled and
backed up weekly to ensure data integrity.
