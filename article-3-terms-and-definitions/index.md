# ISO HSL Article 3: Terms and Definitions

## Purpose

Its purpose is to establish a common understanding of key terms used throughout
the standard. Clear definitions ensure consistency in interpretation and
application, especially for organizations implementing multiple ISO management
system standards.

1. **Standardize language** across users and industries by defining key terms used in the standard.

2. **Avoid ambiguity**, misinterpretation, or confusion when applying the requirements of the standard.

3. **Reference common vocabulary** (often ISO 9000 or similar standards) to maintain alignment across different ISO management systems.

4. **Support implementation and auditing** by ensuring everyone—implementers, auditors, and stakeholders—shares the same understanding of critical concepts.

## Checklist

Use the following checklist to evaluate whether Article 3 is clear, complete, and effective:

1. **Are all key terms used in the standard defined?**

   * Check that all important or technical terms appearing in the requirements or clauses are explained.

2. **Is a reference to external vocabulary (like ISO 9000) provided?**

   * Many ISO standards refer to other documents (e.g., ISO 9000) for definitions to avoid repetition.

3. **Are definitions consistent with other ISO standards?**

   * Verify that terms shared across ISO standards (e.g., "risk", "context", "nonconformity") have the same meaning.

4. **Are terms clearly and unambiguously defined?**

   * Ensure there is no room for misinterpretation. Each term should be concise and context-specific.

5. **Is the structure of definitions user-friendly?**

   * Are the definitions presented in alphabetical or logical order? Are notes or examples included when needed?

6. **Are acronyms and abbreviations explained?**

   * If acronyms are used, are they spelled out and defined the first time they appear?

7. **Are cross-references to definitions in other sections accurate?**

   * Make sure any cross-references to other clauses or external standards are current and correct.

## Example

Let’s take an example from **ISO 14001:2015** (Environmental Management Systems).

* **3. Terms and Definitions**. For the purposes of this document, the terms and
  definitions given in ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 14050:2009 apply.

* **3.1 environment**. Surroundings in which an organization operates, including
 air, water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna, humans, and their
 interrelation.

* **3.2 environmental aspect**. Element of an organization's activities or
products or services that interacts or can interact with the environment.

* **3.3 compliance obligations**. Legal requirements that an organization has to
comply with and other requirements that it chooses to or is expected to comply
with.
