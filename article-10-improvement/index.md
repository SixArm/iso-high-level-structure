# ISO HLS Article 10: Improvement

This summary is by OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Purpose

**Article 10: Improvement** is the **final pillar** of the ISO High-Level Structure (HLS), focusing on **continuous improvement**, **corrective actions**, and responses to **nonconformities**. This article ensures that organizations not only monitor performance (as outlined in Article 9) but actively use those insights to **make things better over time**.

Improvement is not a one-time event—it's a mindset. Article 10 drives organizations to:

* Learn from failures and feedback

* Eliminate the causes of problems

* Systematically enhance system performance, effectiveness, and stakeholder satisfaction

Objectives:

1. **React to nonconformities** and prevent recurrence.

2. **Take corrective action** based on root cause analysis.

3. **Promote continual improvement** across the system.

## Checklist

Use this checklist to verify whether your organization's improvement processes meet ISO expectations:

**10.1 General Improvement:**

* Are opportunities for improvement actively identified?

* Are improvements made to enhance:

  * Process performance?

  * Customer satisfaction?

  * Compliance or safety?

* Are lessons learned used to refine the management system?

**10.2 Nonconformity and Corrective Action:**

* Is there a documented process for handling nonconformities?

* When a nonconformity occurs:

  * Is it reacted to and contained?

  * Is the root cause identified?

  * Are corrective actions implemented and evaluated?

* Are actions taken to prevent recurrence, not just fix symptoms?

* Is all activity recorded and reviewed?

**10.3 Continual Improvement:**

* Is continual improvement a formal goal of the management system?

* Are performance data (from audits, reviews, complaints, etc.) used to drive improvements?

* Is a culture of improvement supported by leadership and resources?

## Example: ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health & Safety Management System)

**10.1 General Improvement**. A construction company implements a new
incident-reporting mobile app to make hazard reporting faster and more
accessible—based on employee feedback during safety meetings.

**10.2 Nonconformity and Corrective Action**. A fall incident occurs at a job
site. The root cause analysis finds that safety harness inspections were not
being logged. Corrective actions include retraining workers, revising the PPE
checklist, and implementing an electronic logging system. Effectiveness is
verified through monthly audits.

**10.3 Continual Improvement**. The company tracks leading safety indicators
(like near-miss reports) and sets a goal to increase reporting by 30% to boost
proactive risk management. As a result, they reduce actual incidents by 15% over
the year.
