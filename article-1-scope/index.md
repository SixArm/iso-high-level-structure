# ISO HSL Article 1: Scope

This summary is by OpenAI ChatGPT.

Defines the intended purpose and application range of any management system
standard that adopts the HLS. It clarifies that the scope outlines the specific
subject area the standard addresses—such as quality, environment, or
occupational health and safety—and specifies the types of organizations or
contexts in which it can be applied. This article sets the boundaries for how
the standard should be used and what it aims to achieve, serving as the
foundation for aligning various management system standards under a unified,
consistent framework.

## Purpose

Article 1 of any ISO standard is the section that describes the **scope** of the
standard. Article 1 will typically state the specific system or management
approach the standard governs, such as quality, environmental, or information
security management.

It defines:

* **The purpose** of the standard.

* **The areas or processes** the standard applies to.

* **Exclusions**: It clarifies any aspects or processes that are outside the
  scope of the standard, ensuring users are clear about where the standard
  should and should not be applied.

* **Target audience**: Who the standard is intended for, i.e., the
  organizations, industries, or sectors that should adopt it.


## Details

Here’s a breakdown of typical contents found in the **Scope** section of an ISO standard:

**Purpose of the Standard:**

* This section explains **why** the standard was created and what objectives it
  aims to achieve. For example, ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) aims to
  enhance customer satisfaction through effective system implementation.

**Target Audience and Applicability:**

* Identifies who the standard is intended for. This could be industries,
  organizations, or individuals. For instance, ISO 14001 is targeted towards
  organizations that need to manage their environmental responsibilities.

**Boundaries:**

* Specifies the areas of application for the standard. It will mention the
  processes, activities, or management systems covered by the standard.

**Exclusions or Limitations:**

* If there are any exclusions, this is where they are stated. For example, a
  standard may not apply to certain processes, activities, or industries.

**International Context:**

* It may also define whether the standard is globally applicable or if it has
  region-specific limits or criteria.

### Checklist

Here’s a checklist to ensure all necessary aspects of the Scope section are covered:

**What is the primary purpose of the standard?**

* Is the purpose clearly defined (e.g., to improve quality, manage environmental
  impact, enhance safety)?

**Who is the intended audience?**

* Is the target group (industry, organization type, or specific management area)
  identified?

**What processes, activities, or areas are covered by the standard?**

* Is there a clear description of what is included within the scope (e.g.,
  organizational processes, specific operational activities)?

**Are there exclusions or limitations mentioned?**

* Does the scope make clear what is not covered (e.g., certain industry sectors,
  types of processes, or geographic regions)?

**Is the standard globally applicable, or is it region-specific?**

* Does the standard clarify its global applicability or its adaptation to
  certain local/regional requirements?

**Does it align with high-level structure?**

* Ensure that the scope aligns with the consistent format established by ISO’s
  High-Level Structure (HLS) for easy implementation across various standards.

## Example: ISO 9001

**Purpose**: To provide a framework for improving quality and ensuring customer
satisfaction through the implementation of a quality management system (QMS).

**Applicability**: It applies to any organization that seeks to establish or
improve a QMS.

**Boundaries**: It applies to all processes that affect the quality of products
and services within the organization.

**Exclusions**: The standard may exclude certain organizations from specific
clauses based on their size or nature (e.g., small businesses or
non-manufacturing entities might not need to implement all clauses).

**International Context**: It can be applied in any country, but specific local
regulations may require adaptation.
